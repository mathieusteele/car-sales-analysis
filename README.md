# Overview

I wanted to help a car dealer analyze some data from their car inventory database. I wanted to help them out because they have helped me out when I needed help with vehicles.

The data set shows about ten years of history for cars purchased and sold and some attributes of the sale and the vehicle. I know the owner of the dealership and I created the inventory management tool that they use.

My hope is that this analysis can be insightful to help improve future car acquisition strategy.

# Data Analysis Results

I had the following questions:

1. Which Brand has on average been the most profitable for the car dealership?
   1. I found that there were some outliers in the data. One vehicle made by Isuzu skewed the results and it was helpful to see the data in this light.
2. Has the average profit per vehicle improved over time?? What impact did Covid vehicle shortages have on profit?
   1. This showed an interesting finding that the average profit per vehicle rose over $500 at the time of the covid vehicle shortages in 2021 and into the first half of 2022.
3. What car make spends the shortest amount of time on the lot, on average?
   1. I thought that this would be helpful in determining which cars to buy because cash tied up in inventory can be a hard problem to solve in retail. Buying cars that will turn over more quickly can mean higher overall profits. If a salesman can sell one car per week even at a lower $500 profit, that will work out better than one car per month at $1000 profit. As the saying goes, it is better to make a quick nickel than a slow dime.

# Development Environment

I used Python and the pandas library to analyze the data set.

# Useful Websites

* [Pandas Website](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Future Work

* Fix the analysis of question 3 - it is not working correctly.
* Brainstorm actionable questions that will lead to valuable insights.
